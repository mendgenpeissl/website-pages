From here the inhabitants have a beautiful view over Vienna. lts south-western part faces a park, its north-eastern part neighbours an industrial site, a former train station. \nThe question was: How can I get as much light as possible into the building? And at the same time create as much living and working space as possible? \nI decided to open the site to the south so that the sunlight can reach the building behind as well. The developed break was closed by a two storys building.","data":[{"content":"2006","title":"year"},{"content":"Anna Mendgen @ TU Wien","title":"design"}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"vienna-housing","wide":true}},
