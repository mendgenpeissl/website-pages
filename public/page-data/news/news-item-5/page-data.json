(2023) Entwicklung von Prototypen für Balkone und\nLoggien aus Infraleichtbeton (ILC) unter Berücksichtigung bauphysikalischer\nAspekte und der Anforderungen aus der Fertigung. Bautechnik.\n[https://doi.org/10.1002/bate.202100098](https://doi.org/10.1002/bate.202100098)\n\n\n\nWithin the framework of the DBU funded research project ILVO\nprefabricated elements made of ILC were developed from 2019\nuntil 2021. The resulting prototypes were exhibited in 2022/2023\nin the form of models at the exhibition “Technoscape: The Architecture\nof Engineers” (curators: Maristella Casciato, Pippo\nCiorra) at MAXXI Museum in Rome. Building with Infra-Lightweight\nConcrete (ILC) can offer several advantages in comparison\nwith conventional thermal insulation composite systems. In\nmulti-story housing this becomes obvious especially where\nwindows, balconies and loggias are constructed. Details which\nare usually complicated and lead to a number of problems in\nthe areas of thermal bridges can be thought in a new way. In\nthe following the benefits of building with large-sized components\nof ILC are introduced. Further the basic requirements for\nthe design, construction as well as the production of prototypes\nof ILC are explained. The development of three prototypes\n(french balcony, balcony and loggia) is shown and evaluated.\nFurthermore, a reference is made to serial construction in\nbuilding construction and civil engineering.\n\n","images":{"data":[{"attributes":{"alternativeText":"prototypes_mendgen.jpg","height":962,"width":1054,"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/mendgenpeissl/image/upload/v1679232520/prototypes_mendgen_3711993671.jpg","formats":{"thumbnail":{"ext":".jpg","url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/mendgenpeissl/image/upload/v1679232520/thumbnail_prototypes_mendgen_3711993671.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_prototypes_mendgen_3711993671","mime":"image/jpeg","name":"thumbnail_prototypes_mendgen.jpg","path":null,"size":6.14,"width":171,"height":156,"provider_metadata":{"public_id":"thumbnail_prototypes_mendgen_3711993671","resource_type":"image"}}},"hash":"prototypes_mendgen_3711993671"}}]},"startDate":"2023-03-14","endDate":null}}]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"news-item-5","wide":true}},
